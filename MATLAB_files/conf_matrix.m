function cm = conf_matrix(truth, estimation)
  % Construct confusion matrix using the true adjacency and estimated adjacency matrices of
  % the network. Can be used both directed and undirected networks.
  %
  % Inputs
  %   truth       The true p by p adjacency matrix of the network.
  %   estimation  The estimated \code{p} by \code{p} adjacency matrix of the network.
  % 
  % Outputs
  %   cm          A 2 by 2 table, where the first element is number of the true positives (TP),
  %               second element is number of the false negatives (FN), third element is number of
  %               the falste positives (FP) and last element is number of the true negatives (TN).
