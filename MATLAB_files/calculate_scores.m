function scores = calculate_scores(cm)
  % This function calculates performance scores for network estimation. The scores are same as binary
  % classification scores as the adjacency matrices are binary matrices.
  % 
  % Inputs
  %   cm  The 2 by 2 confusion matrix calculated using the function conf_matrix() or
  %       manually created 2 by 2 matrix using following order:
  %         TP  FN
  %         FP  TN
  %
  % Outputs:
  %   scores    A table, which contains following scores:
  %     ACC       Accuracy, which is (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FN + FP).
  %     ACC_bal   Balanced accuracy, which is (TPR + TNR) / 2.
  %     MCC       Matthews correlation coefficient, which is (TP * TN - FP * FN) / sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FP)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}.
  %     F1        F1-score, which is 2(PPV * TPR) / (PPV + TPR).
  %     TPR       True positive rate (or recall or sensitivity), which is TP / (TP + TN).
  %     TNR       True negative rate (or specificity or selectivity), which is TN / (TN + FP).
  %     PPV       Positive predictive value (or precision), which is TP / (TP + FP).
  %     NPV       Negative predictive value, which is TN / (TN + FN).
  %     FPR       False positive rate (type I error), which is 1 - TNR.
  %     FNR       False negative rate (type II error), which is 1 - TPR.
  %     FDR       False discovery rate, which is 1 - PPV.
  %     FOR       False omission rate, which is 1 - NPV.
  %     LRp       Positive likelihood ratio, which is TPR / FPR.
  %     LRn       Negative likelihood ratio, which is FNR / TNR.
